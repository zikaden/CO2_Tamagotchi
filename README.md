# CO2 Tamagotchi

This Express app uses geolocation tracking to monitore and positively re-enforece green movement. 
It was set up as a pair-programming project with nalipay (https://github.com/nalipay), fulfilling the requirements of 
a basic Full-stack Web Application with a validation model, a user CRUD and an adittional CRUD model.

How it works:

* you can get your own tamagotchi here: https://co2tamagotchi-iibn2x3pq-zikaden.vercel.app/
* sign up and create your own unique green tamagotchi
* monitore your green movement (walking, cycling, public transport) using the tamagotchi interface
* you may also use the geolocation tracking for monitoring
* your tamagotchi will envolve as you accumulate kms
